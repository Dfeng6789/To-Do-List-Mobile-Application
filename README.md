# To-Do-List Mobile Application
iOS Mobile Application for user based to-do lists. Users can create an account with a unique username, and then log in and add to and remove from their list items. 
List items for each user are stored in a Firebase relational database, and clicking on a list item allows users to edit the item, with these changes reflected in Firebase. 

The specific Google API access related files have been deleted, however a separate Firebase relational database can be created and used to the same effect with the correct setup.
